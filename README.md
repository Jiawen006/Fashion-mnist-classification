# Fashion-mnist-classification
I created three deep learning models that classify images from the fashion mnist database. 
Additionally, I employed the SAM optimizer to compare it performance with SGD and ADAM. 
Furthermore, I implemented adversarial training to enhance the models' robustness against attacks.
